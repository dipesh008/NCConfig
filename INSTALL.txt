INSTALLATION
------------

1. Download and extract NCConfig.

   To download and extract the files, on a typical Unix/Linux command line, use
   the following commands (assuming you want version x.y of MyTrend in .tar.gz
   format):

     tar -zxvf NCConfig-x.y.tar.gz
     
     unzip NCConfig-x.y.zip

   This will create a new directory NCConfig-x.y/ containing all NCConfig files and
   directories. Then, to move the contents of that directory into a directory
   within your web server's document root or your public HTML directory,
   continue with this command:

     mv NCConfig-x.y/* /path/to/your/installation

2. Create the NCConfig database.

   Because NCConfig stores all site information in a database, you must create
   this database in order to install NCConfig, and grant NCConfig certain database
   privileges (such as the ability to create tables). For details, consult
   INSTALL.mysql.txt.

   Take note of the username, password, database name, and hostname as you
   create the database. You will enter this information during the install.

3. Config Changes.
   
   a. config/settings.ini.php
      Add the mysql database credential details in settings.ini.php

   b. config/config.php
      Do the changes in your config file like adding domain name, root path, SVN path etc.

   c. mycronic.php
      Add the mysql database credential details in mycronic.php

   The most common steps you may need to perform are:

   a. Permissons.

      For example, on a Unix/Linux command line, you can grant everyone
      (including the web server) permission to write to the sites/default
      directory with this command:

      chmod -R 777 cache
